<h1 align="center">📊  Olist E-Commerce Analysis </h1>

<br>

  I am sharing my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization using Python. The goal is to audit
business performance by quantifying patterns in sales seasonality, logistics efficiency, and customer behavior.

<h2>🪪 About the Project</h2>

  Olist is a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses with the country's main marketplaces. Operating as a 
  SaaS technology company, it facilitates the sale of products from thousands of sellers to millions of customers.
This project consisted of an Olist performance audit (2016-2018) using real public data. Although the company shows a **strong positive trend in sales**, it 
faces a critical **retention** challenge:  89.5% of customers never buy again.

<br>
<h2>🛠️ Technical Stack and Methodology</h2>

- **Data cleaning:**  Management of null values, conversion of data types (timestamps), and merging of eight relational data sets.
- **Geospatial analysis:**  Mapping of customer distribution and calculation of delay rates by state (comparison between SLA and actual delivery).
- **Customer segmentation:** Identification of repeat users and purchasing patterns using advanced aggregation operations (`groupby`, `nunique`).
- **Logistics optimization:** Detection of critical states (AL, MA, SE) with delay rates above 15%, suggesting the need for regional distribution centers.

<h2>⛓️‍💥 Main question:</h2>
How can we optimize the customer experience to maximize retention and lifetime value?
